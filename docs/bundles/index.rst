Talk bundles
============

A talk bundle is a container for all resources tied to a particular talk. This
container -- normally an archive file or a simple directory -- contains
metadata, documents, slideshows, videos and every other talk-related resource.

Such a talk bundle is intended to be self-contained and to contain all
necessary resources to successfully publish a talk.

The general structure of such a container is presented below but can be
completely customized as presented later in this chapter:
